## The code
We provide Sagemath code, which we used to build the tables.

## Tables for Carmichael Numbers
We provide tables for Carmichael numbers.

For instance,

*5-80.txt* contains Carmichael numbers with 5 to 80 prime factors.

*2542.txt* contains a Carmichael number with 2542 prime factors.

## Get the tables
You can download the source code with the tables by

```sh
git clone https://github.com/drazioti/Carmichael.git
```
